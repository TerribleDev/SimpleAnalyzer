## What is this?

A nuget package that installs all the general Live analyzers in one go. 

## Why?

In VS 2015, you can have Live Analyzers that act as live code quality tools (think resharper). This package references common packages that provide some great refactoring. 

In short you can nuget install this package to soak up multiple useful nuget packages.
